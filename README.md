## Introduction
Welcome to the project AI-Powered Agentic Workflow for Project Management! Imagine yourself as a highly sought-after AI Workflow Architect who specializes in implementing intelligent agentic systems that don't just automate tasks, but dynamically manage them. Your newest client, InnovateNext Solutions, a rapidly scaling startup brimming with brilliant ideas but hampered by inconsistent project execution, has a critical challenge they believe only you can solve.

They are seeking a revolutionary way to manage their entire product development lifecycle. Your goal is to step in and engineer a sophisticated, reusable agentic workflow. This agentic workflow will assist the existing technical project managers (TPMs) on their team by ensuring their various product ideas can be consistently and scalably transformed into well-defined user stories, product features, and detailed engineering tasks. You will pioneer this system by first applying it to their upcoming "Email Router" project as a pilot.

The Challenge: Building a Scalable Engine for Innovation
TPMs at InnovateNext Solutions are overburdened and face a significant bottleneck: due to their significant workload, turning the multiple product ideas they are handling, into actionable development plans is leading to miscommunications, varied output quality, and delays across all their projects. They need a foundational, AI-driven project management framework that can be applied company-wide.

Your role as an AI Workflow Architect is twofold:

First, you'll construct a robust library of diverse, reusable AI agents – the versatile building blocks for this and future advanced agentic systems. This is about crafting your core, adaptable toolkit.
Then, you'll deploy a selection of these agents to build the general-purpose agentic workflow for technical project management. You will demonstrate its power and flexibility by using their "Email Router" product specification (Product-Spec-Email-Router.txt) as the initial input for this pilot implementation.
The Audience for your solution are the technical project managers and the leadership team, particularly the Head of Product and Lead Technical Program Manager, at InnovateNext Solutions. They are looking for a robust system that not only works for the Email Router but also assists the technical project managers at InnovateNext for future product development.

Your Product: AI-Powered Agentic Workflow for Project Management (Pilot: Email Router)
You will deliver a two-part solution:

Phase 1: The Agentic Toolkit

A Python package (workflow_agents) containing seven agent classes (base_agents.py). You implement six of them; RAGKnowledgePromptAgent is provided for you:
DirectPromptAgent
AugmentedPromptAgent
KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent
RAGKnowledgePromptAgent (provided, but understand its role)
EvaluationAgent
RoutingAgent
ActionPlanningAgent
Standalone test scripts for each agent, proving their individual capabilities, along with screenshots of successful test runs.
Phase 2: The Project Management Workflow Implementation

A primary Python script (agentic_workflow.py) that orchestrates a selection of your Phase 1 agents (ActionPlanningAgent, KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent, EvaluationAgent, RoutingAgent) to perform the multi-step technical project management task. This script will be designed as a general-purpose workflow.
For the pilot, this workflow will:
Accept a high-level prompt (simulating a TPM's request) and InnovateNext's Product-Spec-Email-Router.txt (as the example product spec).
Employ an Action Planning Agent to break down the overall goal into logical sub-tasks.
Utilize a Routing Agent to intelligently assign each sub-task to the appropriate specialized agent team.
Simulate a Product Manager team (a KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for generating user stories based on the provided product spec, paired with an EvaluationAgent to ensure stories meet specific criteria.
Simulate a Program Manager team (a KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for defining product features, paired with an EvaluationAgent to ensure features meet criteria.
Simulate a Development Engineer team (a KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for creating detailed engineering tasks, paired with an EvaluationAgent to ensure tasks meet criteria.
Produce a final, structured output representing the comprehensively planned project (for the Email Router), demonstrating the workflow's capability.
Project Submission
At the end of the project, you will need to submit the following documents for review:

Phase 1:
Fully implemented reusable agent library (workflow_agents/base_agents.py).
Test scripts for each agent in the reusable agent library
Outputs from running the seven testing scripts in the form of screenshots or text files containing terminal outputs.
Phase 2:
Completed Python script (agentic_workflow.py) which implements the agentic workflow for technical project management for the email router product specification.
Output from the agentic workflow in the form of screenshots or a text file containing the terminal output.
Your submission zip must contain only the items listed above. Do not include your virtual environment, your .env file, __pycache__ directories, or any datasets — extra items cause the submission to fail with a generic error that does not explain the cause.

# Purpose of This Repo

This repo is meant to be used to keep things organized during content development and act as the source of truth for all projects and exercises related to this course.

## Folder Structure

### Lesson Folder

This repo contains a folder for each `lesson` and one `project` folder.

Example
```
lesson-1-hello
lesson-2-world
lesson-3-foo
lesson-4-bar
project
```

Each `lesson` folder is named using the naming convention of `lesson-#-name-of-lesson`.

Example
```
lesson-1-hello
```

Four lesson folders have been provided as a template; However, you may need to add more or possibly use less than four depending on what is needed.

If you require an additional lesson folder, you can make a copy of the folder and paste it into the root directory.

### Exercises Folder

Each `lesson` folder contains an `exercises` folder. This `exercises` folder should contain all files and instructions necessary for the exercises along with the solution. The solutions for these exercises will be shared with students. See the `README` in the `exercises` folder for information about folder structure.

### Project Folder

The `project` folder should contain all files and instructions necessary for setup. If possible, a set of instructions should be provided for both Udacity workspaces and a way to work locally (for both MacOS and Windows OS). At a minimum, one set of instructions should be provided. A `README` template has been provided in the project folder. This template layout should be used to write your README.
